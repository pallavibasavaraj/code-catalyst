# code-catalyst
a new energy conservation and opti reduce project
The project utilizes Python for backend development along with Flask framework while leveraging HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development.
By incorporating these technologies into an integrated solution for energy-saving projections.
       Yes, the project involves recommendation and prediction aspects as well. The system will use ML concepts to make recommendations for optimal energy-saving settings based on the environmental conditions, usage patterns, and user preferences. Additionally, it will utilize predictive models to anticipate energy consumption levels and adjust projection parameters accordingly for efficient power management. This recommendation and prediction functionality aims to provide a seamless and proactive approach towards energy conservation while delivering an enhanced user experience.
